## Your Financial Mess

- Alright mate, let's be blunt. We need to reassess your priorities because this currently isn't good enough. Based on what you've told me, you're in a financial hole if you have consumer debt.
- It looks like you have about **$${potentialMonthlySavings.toFixed(0)} a month** you could be using to clean this up. That's your shovel. Start digging.
- **Debt:** This is an emergency. Credit card debt is not a tool, it's a trap, and it's stupid. If you have loans for toys like a boat or a fancy car you can't afford, you need to sell them. Yesterday. You don't get a life of leisure until that credit card debt is paid down. That stuff is an anchor dragging you to the bottom.

---

## The Plan to Not Be Broke

- Your goal is **${primaryGoal}**. You can't even think about that seriously until your consumer debt is gone. That's Step Zero.
- Your current habits are keeping you broke. We need to change them, now.
- **The Plan:**
  1.  Save $1,000 for a baby emergency fund. Don't touch it unless it's a real emergency.
  2.  Use the debt snowball. List your debts smallest to largest, ignore interest rates. Attack the smallest one with every spare dollar you have. When it's gone, roll that payment into the next one. This is "gazelle intensity." You're running from a predator.
  3.  Cut up your credit cards. All of them. You don't use them anymore.
