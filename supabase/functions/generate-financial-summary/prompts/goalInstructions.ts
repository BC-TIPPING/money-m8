- **The Barefoot Investor Steps:** The "Barefoot Investor" by Scott Pape is a bestseller in Australia because it's simple and it works. Here are a few key steps to get started:
    - **1. Schedule a Monthly 'Barefoot Date Night':** This is your dedicated time to manage your money. Order a pizza, make it fun!
    - **2. Set Up Your Buckets:** Open different bank accounts for different purposes: Daily Expenses (for everyday spending), Smile (for short-term goals like holidays), and Fire Extinguisher (for long-term goals like a house deposit or crushing debt). This gives every dollar a job.
    - **3. Domino Your Debts:** List your debts from smallest to largest (ignoring interest rates). Make minimum payments on all, but throw every spare dollar at the smallest one. Once it's gone, you take that entire repayment amount and "snowball" it onto the next smallest debt. This builds massive momentum.

**Debt Reduction Scenarios (Snowball Method)**
- Recap their current debts from the data provided (type, balance, interest rate, and monthly repayment).
- The "debt snowball" strategy focuses on paying off the debt with the lowest balance first, while making minimum payments on all other debts. Once a debt is paid off, its minimum payment is rolled into the payment for the next-smallest debt.

- **Here is how you MUST calculate the scenarios:**
  - For each extra weekly repayment scenario ($0, $50, $100, $200, $500), you must perform a month-by-month simulation.
  - Convert the extra weekly payment to a monthly amount by multiplying by 4.33.
  - The total monthly payment for debts is the sum of all minimum monthly repayments plus the extra monthly amount.
  - **Simulation Example:** Let's say we have two debts:
    1.  Credit Card: $2,000 balance, $50 min. payment, 20% interest rate.
    2.  Car Loan: $8,000 balance, $200 min. payment, 8% interest rate.
    - And we add an extra $50/week (approx $217/month).
    - The lowest balance debt is the Credit Card. It's the "snowball" target.
    - Total monthly debt payment = $50 + $200 + $217 = $467.
    - **Month 1:**
      - First, calculate and add interest for the month to each loan's balance.
      - CC Interest: $2,000 * (0.20 / 12) = $33.33. New CC Balance: $2,033.33.
      - Car Loan Interest: $8,000 * (0.08 / 12) = $53.33. New Car Loan Balance: $8,053.33.
      - Then, apply payments. You pay the minimum on the Car Loan: $200.
      - The rest of the budget goes to the Credit Card: $467 - $200 = $267.
      - Final CC Balance: $2,033.33 - $267 = $1,766.33.
      - Final Car Loan Balance: $8,053.33 - $200 = $7,853.33.
    - **Continue this simulation month by month.** When the Credit Card is paid off, its $50 minimum payment gets added to the Car Loan payment. The new Car Loan payment becomes $250 + $217 = $467.
  - After running the simulation for each scenario, you will have the total months to be debt-free.

- **Create a markdown table** to show the results. The columns MUST be: "Extra / week", "Time Saved", "Interest Saved", "Debt-Free Date".
- The values in the "Extra / week" column should be prefixed with a dollar sign (e.g., $50).
- **"Time Saved"** is the difference in time between the "$0 extra" scenario payoff time and the current scenario's payoff time. It should be in years and months (e.g., "1 year, 2 months"). For the "$0 extra" row, this value should be "-".
- **"Interest Saved"** is the interest paid in the "$0 extra" scenario minus the interest paid in the current scenario. It should be a whole number, prefixed with a dollar sign and with commas for thousands (e.g., $400, $1,400).
- **"Debt-Free Date"** is calculated from today. It should be formatted as Month YYYY (e.g., "Mar 2031").
- You **MUST** output real numbers in the table, not placeholders like [Time] or [Amount].
- ${motivationalSummary}
- Use Australian currency ($).

- **CHART DATA INSTRUCTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT):**
- After the entire markdown summary, on a new line, you MUST provide a JSON object prefixed with \`CHART_DATA::\`.
- This JSON object must contain a key \`debtReductionData\`, which is an array of objects for the chart.
- Each object in the array represents a month in the simulation.
- Each object MUST have a \`month\` key (0, 1, 2, ...) and keys for the remaining total debt balance for each scenario.
- The keys for the scenarios MUST be: \`no_extra\`, \`50_extra\`, \`100_extra\`, \`200_extra\`, \`500_extra\`.
- The data must continue until the debt is fully paid off in the longest scenario (\`no_extra\`).
- **Example JSON output:**
\`\`\`json
CHART_DATA::{"debtReductionData": [{"month": 0, "no_extra": 20000, "50_extra": 20000, "100_extra": 20000, "200_extra": 20000, "500_extra": 20000}, {"month": 1, "no_extra": 19800, "50_extra": 19600, "100_extra": 19400, "200_extra": 19000, "500_extra": 18200}]}
