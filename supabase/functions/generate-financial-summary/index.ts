**Debt Reduction Scenarios (Snowball Method)**
- Recap their current debts from the data provided (type, balance, interest rate, and monthly repayment).
- The "debt snowball" strategy focuses on paying off the debt with the lowest balance first, while making minimum payments on all other debts. Once a debt is paid off, its minimum payment is rolled into the payment for the next-smallest debt.

- **Here is how you MUST calculate the scenarios:**
  - For each extra weekly repayment scenario ($0, $10, $25, $50, $100), you must perform a month-by-month simulation.
  - Convert the extra weekly payment to a monthly amount by multiplying by 4.33.
  - The total monthly payment for debts is the sum of all minimum monthly repayments plus the extra monthly amount.
  - **Simulation Example:** Let's say we have two debts:
    1.  Credit Card: $2,000 balance, $50 min. payment, 20% interest rate.
    2.  Car Loan: $8,000 balance, $200 min. payment, 8% interest rate.
    - And we add an extra $50/week (approx $217/month).
    - The lowest balance debt is the Credit Card. It's the "snowball" target.
    - Total monthly debt payment = $50 + $200 + $217 = $467.
    - **Month 1:**
      - First, calculate and add interest for the month to each loan's balance.
      - CC Interest: $2,000 * (0.20 / 12) = $33.33. New CC Balance: $2,033.33.
      - Car Loan Interest: $8,000 * (0.08 / 12) = $53.33. New Car Loan Balance: $8,053.33.
      - Then, apply payments. You pay the minimum on the Car Loan: $200.
      - The rest of the budget goes to the Credit Card: $467 - $200 = $267.
      - Final CC Balance: $2,033.33 - $267 = $1,766.33.
      - Final Car Loan Balance: $8,053.33 - $200 = $7,853.33.
    - **Continue this simulation month by month.** When the Credit Card is paid off, its $50 minimum payment gets added to the Car Loan payment. The new Car Loan payment becomes $250 + $217 = $467.
  - After running the simulation for each scenario, you will have the total months to be debt-free.

- **Create a markdown table** to show the results. The columns MUST be: "Extra Weekly Repayment", "New Payoff Time", "Total Interest Saved", "Debt-Free Date".
- **"New Payoff Time"** should be in years and months (e.g., "3 years, 4 months").
- **"Total Interest Saved"** is the interest paid in the "$0 extra" scenario minus the interest paid in the current scenario.
- **"Debt-Free Date"** is calculated from today: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-AU', { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' })}.
- You **MUST** output real numbers in the table, not placeholders like [Time] or [Amount].
- Provide a motivational summary highlighting how a small extra contribution can save thousands of dollars and years of repayments.
- Use Australian currency ($) and provide all monetary values formatted nicely (e.g., $5,123.45).

- **CHART DATA INSTRUCTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT):**
- After the entire markdown summary, on a new line, you MUST provide a JSON object prefixed with \`CHART_DATA::\`.
- This JSON object must contain a key \`debtReductionData\`, which is an array of objects for the chart.
- Each object in the array represents a month in the simulation.
- Each object MUST have a \`month\` key (0, 1, 2, ...) and keys for the remaining total debt balance for each scenario.
- The keys for the scenarios MUST be: \`no_extra\`, \`10_extra\`, \`25_extra\`, \`50_extra\`, \`100_extra\`.
- The data must continue until the debt is fully paid off in the longest scenario (\`no_extra\`).
- **Example JSON output:**
\`\`\`json
CHART_DATA::{"debtReductionData": [{"month": 0, "no_extra": 20000, "10_extra": 20000, "25_extra": 20000, "50_extra": 20000, "100_extra": 20000}, {"month": 1, "no_extra": 19800, "10_extra": 19750, "25_extra": 19700, "50_extra": 19600, "100_extra": 19500}]}
