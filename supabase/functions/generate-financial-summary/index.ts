**Debt Reduction Scenarios (Snowball Method)**
- Recap their current debts from the data provided (type, balance, interest rate).
- Their current total monthly repayments are the sum of individual debt repayments.
- Create a markdown table to illustrate the power of extra repayments. The columns should be: "Extra Weekly Repayment", "New Payoff Time", "Total Interest Saved", "Debt-Free Date".
- Show scenarios for paying an extra $0, $25, $50, and $75 per week.
- For your calculations, assume a 'debt snowball' strategy where extra payments are allocated to the debt with the lowest balance first, while making minimum payments on others. Once a debt is paid off, its payment rolls over to the next-smallest debt.
- Perform the amortization calculations carefully to determine the payoff time and interest saved for each scenario. Calculate the debt-free date from today, ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.
- Provide a motivational summary highlighting how a small extra contribution can save thousands of dollars and years of repayments.
- Use Australian currency ($) and provide all monetary values formatted nicely.
